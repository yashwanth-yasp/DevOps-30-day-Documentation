- `terraform apply`
    - It does apply on all the .tf files in the current directory
- `.tfstate` file
    - has information of what things were created last time
- Terraform is smart enough to compare the .tf files, .tfstate file and the cloud to check for all changes and then modify
- `terraform init`
    - It does three things
        - initialize the backend
            - It decides where the `.tfstate` needs to go
            - Generally you donâ€™t edit or move tfstate files,
        - initializing the plugins
        - creating the log files
