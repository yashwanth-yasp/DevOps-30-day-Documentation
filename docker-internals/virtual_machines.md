- When a virtual machine is loading it follows the same set of steps that a normal OS does - [computer-loading](/vilas_notes/computer_loading.md)
- Docker containers are NOT completly independant operating systems

  - hypervisor can help you create virtual machines 
- Docker container directly uses the host machine's kernel
